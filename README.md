BECOME A TECHATHONIAN 

I was inspired to develop this little project by Techathon community Reactjs Mentor by the name Mr. Chigbo to complement  and simulate backend.

DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT
Sign up to become a member of Techathon communities and have access to dashboard where you can view your registration details. If you dont sign up you can not sign in and at the same time will not be able to see the dashboard.

The project is built using reactJs (npx create-react-app techathonian-form) for single page application and other sependencies like:
        1. react-router-doms (npm install react-router-doms ) for routing to different pages of the app.
        2. protected route was made use of to protect unauthorised user from naviigating to dashboard.
        3. Chakra-Ui for styling.
        4. Browser session storage for simulation of backend/data-base where the user's data is saved and retreived.

        In the project directory, you can run: 
        ### `npm start`

Enjoy Coding ‚ù§
